nmap scanme.nmap.org

nmap 74.207.244.221

nmap 10.1.1.0/24
	this means all 256 addresses
	beginning with 10.1.1

nmap 10.1.50-52.1
	scans 10.1.50.1, 10.1.51.1 and 10.1.52.1

nmap 10.1.50,51,52,57,59.1

Ping Scan

	Technique for determining whether the specified computers are up and running. Nmap performs ping scan by default before port scan to avoid wasting time on hosts that aren't even connected. To instruct nmap to "only" perform ping scan:

		nmap -sP 10.1.1.1/8

	-Pn might be useful when the machine is heavily firewalled. 

Port Scan

	There are three main states a port can be in:

		Open - there is a program listening and responding to requests on this port 

		Closed - the host replies with an "error: no program listening on this port" reply to requests on this port. 

		Filtered - the host doesn't reply at all. This can be due to restrictive firewall rules, which "drop" a packet without sending a reply. 

	3 additional states used when nmap is uncertain:

		open|closed (unfiltered) - the port is either

		closed|filtered - either

		open|filtered - either

	To specify custom port numbers, use -p:

		nmap -p -25,135-137 10.1.1.1

PSD - Port Scan detection
	
	--psd-weight-threshold *threshold*

	--psd-delay-threshold *delay*

	--psd-lo-ports-weight *weight*

	How it works:

		if requests from a single IP have gained a value more than *threshold* in *delay* seconds, then the IP is classified as a port scanner. 


Avoiding detection 

	One of the easiest ways to avoid PSD is to scan slowly

	nmap --scan-delay 3.1. 192.168.56.1

	Limiting Scan Speed

		To send a packet at most every 3.333 seconds:
			
			nmap --max-rate 0.3 192.168.56.1

		To send a packet every 3.1 secs:

			nmap --scan-delay 3.1 192.168.56.1

Specifying targest input from a file 

	some_addresses.txt:
		10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1-10.3
		10.3.1.3 10.3.1.50 10.3.2.55
		10.1.1.100

	nmap -iL some_addresses.txt
