IT forensic analysis deals with the attack after it has happened. 

Methods of Visualization

Univariate Visualization

Univariate data consist of one observed variable per unit measured. Ex: number of bytes per packet or number of IP addresses observed over a period

we use histograms a shit ton. 

Histograms for informational analysis
		
	If you can receive packets at any rate from 0-10,00 a second, you can create 10 bins for the ranges 0 to 999, 1000 to 1999, and so on. frequency would be number of times that the observed value occured within the range of the bin. 

	plt.hist(data, normed=False, bins=420)
