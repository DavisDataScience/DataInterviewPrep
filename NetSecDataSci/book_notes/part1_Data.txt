A single bot may use multiple techniques to infiltrate and attack other hosts on a network. These attacks may include buffer overflows, spreading across network shares, and simple password cracking. 

A bot attacking an SSH server with a password attempt may be logged by that host's SSH logfile, providing concrete evidence of an attack but no information on anything else the bot did. 

Network traffic might not be able to reconstruct sessions, but it can tell you about other actions by the attacker - 
including, say, a long successful session with a host that never reported such a session taking place. 

We must learn to collect enough data to reconstruct rare event, but not so much that we make queries impractical.
