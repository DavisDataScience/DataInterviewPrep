What is quality data?

	Pocket Capture (PCAP) data collected form a scan port can tell you if someone is scanning your network, but it's going to produce terabytes of unreadable traffice from the HTTPS server you're watching. 

	Logs from the HTTPS server will tell you about file accesses, but nothing about the FTP interactions going on as well. 

Sensors are defined as anything on your computer or network that logs I/O information

Sensor classification:

	Vantage:

		The placement of sensors within a network. 
		Sensors with different vantages will see different parts of the same event

	Domain:

		The information the sensor provides, whether that's at the host, a service on the host, or the network. 
		Sensors with the same vantage but different domains provide complementary data about the same data. 

		Host monitoring is the only way to find out if a host has been physically accessed.

	Action:

		How the sensor decides to report information. It may record the data, provide events, or manipulate the traffic that produces the data. 

		Sensors with different actions can potentially interfere with each other. 


Domain in depth:

	A sensor's domain refers to the type of data that the sensor generates and reports. Because sensors include antivirus (AV) and similar systems, where the line of reasoning leading to a message may be opaque, the analyst needs to be aware that these tools import their own biases. 

	The four domain classes:

	Domain     | Data Sources   | Timing     | Identity
	--------------------------------------------------
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	--------------------------------------------------
	Network    | PCAP, NetFlow  |Real-time,  | IP, MAC
								 packet-based
    --------------------------------------------------
	Service	   | Logs			|Event-based | IP, Service
	--------------------------------------------------
	Host	   | System state, 	|Asynchronous| IP, MAC, UUID
				 signature alerts
	--------------------------------------------------
    Active	   | Scanning		|User-driven | IP, 													   Service-based 											IDs

	Network domain data must be readable and meaningful; network traffice contains a lot of garbage

	Service examples: nginx or apache (HTTP daemons), syslog and the processes that are moderated by it. 

	Host applications collect info about the hosts state. 

		Examples: 

			Systems that provide information on system state such as disk space

			Host-based intrusion detection systems such as file integrity monitoring or antivirus systems

	Active domain consists of sensing controlled by the analyst. This includes scanning for vulnerabilites, mapping tools such as tracerout, or even somthing like opening a connection to a new web server to find out what it does. 

Vantage in depth:

	Vantage is determined by an interaction between the sensor's placement and the routing infrastructure of the network.

	Examples of unique potential sensors:

		Monitors the interface that connects the router to the internet

		Monitors the interface that connects the router to the switch

		Monitors the interface that connects the router to the host with IP address 128.2.1.1

		Monitors host 128.2.1.1

		Monitors a spanning port operated by the switch. A spanning port records all traffic that passes the switch. 

		Monitors the interface between the switch and the hub

		Collects HTTP log data on host 128.1.1.2

		Sniffs all TCP traffic on the hub

	HTTP/S traffic is on ports 80 and 443, where 128.1.1.2 is the server

	Types of sensor actions:

		Report (R):
			A report sensor simply provides information on all phenomena that the sensor observes. Report sensors are simple and good for baselining.

		Event (E):

			An event sensor differs from a report sensor in that it consumes multiple data sources to produce an event that summarizes some subset of that data. 

			Event sensors include intrusion detection system and antivirus sensors

		Control (C): 

			A control sensor, like an event sensor, consumes multiple data sources and makes a judgement about that data before reacting. Unlike an event sesor, a control sensor modifies or blocks traffic when it sends an event.  

		In a normal situation:

			R says Normal -> E says Normal -> C says Normal

		In an attack situation:

			R says Attack -> E says "We're Attacked" -> C says "Attack blocked" after blocking it.
