
A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. 
	This end is commonly referred to as the top
	The end opposite the top is known as the 'base'

The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those that have been in the stack the longest.

The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first.

This ordering principle is sometimes called LIFO:last-in, first-out
	It provides an ordering based on the length of time in the collection
	Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base


Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items.

The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal.

Considering the reversal property, you can perhaps think of examples of stacks that occur as you use your computer.
	For example, every web browser has a Back button. This pops out the current webpage URL from the stack!
