Priority Queues:

	One important variation of a queue is called a priority queue.

	A priority queue acts like a queue in that you dequeue an item by removing it from the front.

	However, in a priority queue the logical order of items inside a queue is determined by their priority.

	The highest priority items are at the front of the queue and the lowest priority items are at the back.

	When you enqueue an item on a priority queue, the new item may move all the way to the front. 

Binary Heaps:

	The classic way to implement a priority queue is using a data structure called a binary heap.

	A binary heap will allow us to enqueue and dequeue items in O(logn). Fast!!!

	The binary heap has two common variations: the min heap, in which the smallest key is always at the front - and the max heap, in which the largest key value is always at the front.

	In this section we'll implement the min heap.
