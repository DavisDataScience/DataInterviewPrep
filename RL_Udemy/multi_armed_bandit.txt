Ex: Go to a casino, choice between 3 slot machines

Each (for now) gives reward of 0 or 1

Win rate is unknown (could be 0.1 or 0.99)

Goal: maximize your winnings

Problem: can only discover best bandit by collecting data

If you're psychic, you could just play the bandit with the highest win rate

Balance explore(collecting data) + exploit (playing "best-so-far" machine)

Traditional A/B testing:

	Predetermine # of times you need to play/collect data in order to establish statistical significance

	# of times needed is dependent on numerous things, like the difference between win rates of each bandit

	But you don't know the win rates! (lil catch-22)

	Even if you set N=1000, but after 500 trials, you discover 90% win rate vs 10% win rate

	You still may not stop!

	This is much different from human behavior

		Suppose you're playing in a real casino, you get 2/3 on one bandit, 0/3 on the other

		You have a strong urge to play the first bandit, despite the fact that their true win rates are likely not 67% and 0%, respectively

		You know as a data scientist that 3 is a small sample size, but as a gambler you do not feel that way - sometimes your emotions can override that outsider's logic

		So, a strategy better than A/B testing and Human Emotion-based decisions? We will learn it in this course
