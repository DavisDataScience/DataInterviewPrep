Epsilon-Greedy

Solution to the explore-exploit dilemma we'll use throughout the course

Very simple

Choose small number (epsilon) as probability of exploration

	Typical values are 0.05, 0.10

pseudocode:

	p = random()
	if p < eps:
		pull random arm 
		# explore (look for other options)
	else:
		pull current-best arm 
		# exploit (use this option)

	Eventually this allows us to discover the true best arm, since this allows us to update each arm's estimate

In the long run, this allows us to explore each arm an infinite number of times

Problem: we get to a point where we explore when we don't need to. 

For epsilon=0.10, we'll continue to spend 10% of the time doing suboptimal things.

Could do A/B test at some predetermined time, then set epsilon=0

But we'll learn better ways to adapt.
