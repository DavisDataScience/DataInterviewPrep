There are three commonly used patterns to visit all the nodes in a tree.

The difference between these patterns is the order in which each node is visited (a traversal)

The three traversals we will look at are called preorder, inorder, and postorder.

Preorder:
	
	In a preorder traversal, we visit the root node first, then recursively do a preorder traversal of the left subtree, followed by a preorder traversal of the right subtree.

Inorder:

	In an inorder traversal, we recursively do an inorder traversal on the left subtree, visit the root node, and finally do a recursive inorder traversal of the right subtree. 

Postorder:

	In a preorder traversal, we recursively do a postorder traversal of the left subtree, then the right subtree, followed by a visit to the root node.
