
A deque, also known as a double-ended queue, is an ordered collection of items similar to the queue

It has two ends, a front and rear - and the items remain positioned in the collection.

What makes a deque different is the unrestrictive nature of adding and removing items.

New items can be added at either the front or the rear.

Even though the deque can assume a lot of the characteristics of stacks and queues, it doesn't require LIFO or FIFO orderings

Basically, we can add or remove items from either the front or the back.
