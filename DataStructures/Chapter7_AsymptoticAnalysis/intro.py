# asymptotic analysis is a method to descrie the limiting behavior and the performance of algorithms when applied to very large input datasets
# to understand why asymptotic analysis is important, suppose you have to sort a billion numbers in your desktop
# suppose this computer has a CPU clock time of 1 Ghz
	# this means that it executes 10^9 processor cycles (operations) per second
# The for an algo that has a runtime of O(n^2), it would take approximately one billion secs"
	# it would take about a billion seconds (one year)
