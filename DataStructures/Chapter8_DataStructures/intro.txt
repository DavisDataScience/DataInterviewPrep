An abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for a certain class of datastructures that have similar behavior. Different classes of abstract data typeshave many different but functionally equivalent data structures that implement them.

Data structures can be classified as either contiguous (composed of single slabs of memory) or linked (distinct chunks of memory bound together by pointers)

In Python, contiguously-allocated structures include strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries

In the following sections we will learn how to write abstract data structures, which can either use Python's contiguous structures or be made of pointers
