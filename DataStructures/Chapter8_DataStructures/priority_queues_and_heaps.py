'''
A priority queue is an abstract data type which is similar to a regular queue or stack, but where each element has a priority 
associated with it. 
If two elements  have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.
A sensible implementation of a priority queue is given by a 'heap' data structure

Linked lists are an abstract data structure we'll learn later. 
Doubly here means that their nodes have links to the next and to the previous node.
