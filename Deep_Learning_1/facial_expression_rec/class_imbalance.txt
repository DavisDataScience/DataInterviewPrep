 
Remember that there are a ton more samples from class 0 than from class 1?

Suppose we have class 0 = 1000 vs class 1 = 100

Method 0: Randomly choose 100 from class 0? then we would have 100 vs 100

Method 1: Simply repeat class 2 10 times, now we have 1000 vs 1000

Method 1 is better (less variance, more data)

Other options to expand class 2:
	
	Add Gaussian noise

	Add invariant transformations(shift left, right, rotate, etc)

Precision and Recall 

f1 -> precision and recall (harmonic mean of both)
